 ✔ 1.4 HTML Tags 
➨ The use of tags is the key characteristic of a markup language. Why is it called “markup”? 
➨ A markup language “marks up” a document by surrounding parts of its content with tags.
➨ HTML is a language that supports markup tags for formatting and the ability to jump to other web pages.
▻ Each tag is surrounded by angled brackets.
▻ Consequently, not all browsers display tags in the exact same way.
-The first entity inside a tag is the tag’s type. 
➨There are two types of elements—container elements and void elements. 
1 . A container element (usually called simply a “container”) has a start tag and an end tag, and it contains content between its two tags .
2 . A void element has just one tag, and its content is stored within the tag.
✔ 1.5 Structural Elements 
- Executable code is generated from the source code with the help of something called a compiler. 
- HTML code is source code because HTML code comes directly from the programming source—the programmer.
 ➨ The doctype construct is considered to be an instruction, not an element, and it goes at the top of every web page , tells the browser what type of document the web page is.  
➨ The html, head, and body elements form the basic structure of a web page, so we’ll refer to those elements as structural elements. 
 ✔ 1.6 title Element 
- The head element contains two types of elements—meta and title.
- title element goes within the head container. The title element’s contained data (e.g., “K.C. Weather”) specifies the label that appears in the browser window’s title bar. 
✔ The purpose of the title element
❖ It provides documentation for someone trying to maintain your web page, and
