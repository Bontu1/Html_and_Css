1.2 Creating a Website
A website is a collection of related web pages that are normally stored on a single web server computer. A web server is a computer system that enables users to access web pages stored on the web 
server’s computer.
To create a website, you’ll need these things: (1) a text editor, (2) an upload/publishing tool, 
(3) a web hosting service, and (4) a browser.

Text Editors
There are many different text editors, with varying degrees of functionality. 
Web Page Uploads
After you enter your web page text on your local computer with your favorite IDE, you’ll probably 
want to publish it. Publishing means that you upload your web page to a web server computer so 
other users can access it on the Web. 

Browsers
A browser is a piece of software that enables a user to retrieve and view a web page.
