2.1 Introduction
 Character references allow you to generate characters that are not on a standard keyboard.

2.2 HTML Coding Conventions

For every container element, include both a start tag and an end tag. So even though it’s 
legal to omit a p element’s end tag, don’t do it.
▸ Use lowercase for all tag names and attributes.
▸ Use lowercase for attribute values unless there’s a reason for uppercase. For a meta 
author element, use title case for the author’s name because that’s how people’s names are 
normally spelled.
▸ For attribute-value assignments, surround the value with quotes, and omit spaces around 
the equals sign
